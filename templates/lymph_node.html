      Lymph nodes are tiny round or oval organs found all over your body, and they are connected through a complex system of lymphatic channels. They function to help the body fight infection via white blood cells. They act as filters of anything that should not be in the body, including cancer cells. Metastatic lymph nodes are those that have cancer cells within them (spread from a primary tumor somewhere else).

Lymphatic spread of cancer in the head and neck region results in enlarged lymph nodes in the face or neck (these are called regional lymph nodes because they are in the region of the head and neck).
